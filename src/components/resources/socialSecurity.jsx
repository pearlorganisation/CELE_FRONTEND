        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-700">What are Social Security Death Benefits?</h2>
        <p className="text-lg mt-4">
          Social Security Death Benefits are paid to widows, widowers, and dependents of a deceased eligible worker. This benefit helps families with the financial burden of losing their loved oneâ€™s income.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mt-4">
          The monthly benefit amount is based on the deceased's earnings. The more they paid into Social Security, the higher your benefits.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mt-4">
          Additionally, a one-time lump-sum death payment of $255 may be available for a surviving spouse or eligible child.
