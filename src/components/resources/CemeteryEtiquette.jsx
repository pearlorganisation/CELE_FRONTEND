          Avoid leaving trash or unnecessary items at the gravesite. Always follow the cemetery’s guidelines on tributes and decorations. Be considerate by taking any trash with you or placing it in a trash receptacle.

      {/* Follow the Roadways and Do Not Drive on the Grass Section */}
      <section className="space-y-4">

        <p className="text-gray-600">
          Drive slowly, obey traffic signs, and always stay on the designated roadways. Avoid driving on the grass, as it can damage the grounds and disrupt the peaceful environment of the cemetery.
